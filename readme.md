# Image Steganography with AES Encryption

Steganography is the practice of hiding one piece of information within another, so it goes unnoticed by unintended observers. Image steganography involves hiding data within an image while AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely used encryption algorithm for securing data. Combining steganography with AES encryption can provide a robust method for concealing sensitive information within images.

## How Image Steganography Works

1. **Pixel Modification**: In image steganography, the least significant bits (LSBs) of the image pixels are typically modified to encode the hidden data. Since LSBs contribute the least to the overall pixel color, slight modifications are less likely to be noticeable to the human eye.

2. **Image Formats**: Steganography can be applied to various image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and BMP. However, care must be taken to avoid causing visual artifacts that might raise suspicion.

3. **Embedding Data**: To hide information, the data is divided into smaller chunks, and each chunk is embedded into the LSBs of the image pixels. The changes in pixel values are generally imperceptible to the naked eye.

## Integrating AES Encryption

AES encryption enhances the security of steganography by encrypting the data before it's hidden within the image. This adds an extra layer of protection, making it harder for unauthorized users to access the hidden information.

1. **Data Encryption**: The data intended for hiding within the image is encrypted using AES encryption. AES supports different key lengths (128, 192, or 256 bits), adding complexity to the encryption process.

2. **Steganography Process**: The encrypted data is then embedded within the image using the LSB method, just like in traditional steganography. However, this time, the hidden data is in encrypted form.

3. **Decryption**: To retrieve the hidden information, the image is analyzed to extract the encrypted data. This data is then decrypted using the appropriate AES key, yielding the original sensitive information.

## Use Cases

1. **Secure Communication**: Organizations and individuals can use steganography with AES encryption to securely share confidential information within seemingly innocuous images.

2. **Digital Watermarking**: Content creators can embed copyright or ownership information within images, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to remove or alter the identification.

3. **Censorship Circumvention**: In regions with restricted communication, steganography can be used to hide messages in images, bypassing censorship.
